   <h3><p>  The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, 
    and its world is navigated on foot and by vehicle. Players control the three lead 
    protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions.
     The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay.
      A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. 
    Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety 
    of different cooperative and competitive game modes.</p></h3>
